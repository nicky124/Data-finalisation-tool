This Shiny R tool will allow you to upload a .CSV file. It will:

* Show basic plots to help you to visualise the dataset - primarily to help spot any errors.
* If text is identified (outside of the header row) then the column will be identified as text. 
* Display unique levels within character columns, levels can then be merged (useful for finding and correcting typos). 
* Provides a UI to annotate the dataset
* Allows the raw data, edited data, annotations and modifications to be exported as csvs in a single .zip file

Requirements

* R
* Rstudio
* R packages: shiny, shinyBS, ggplot2, reshape2, plyr, data.table
